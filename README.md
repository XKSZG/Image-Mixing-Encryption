项目名称：Image Mixing Encryption

项目描述：通过对图像拆解再混合达到加密的效果。

加密和解密流程:
    加密流程：图形准备拆解时，会根据边裁剪数生成一个随机种子（16位），通过种子生成图块组合顺序和旋转顺序，然后将图块组合成一个完整的加密图像，
            最后将图片原大小，边裁剪数，种子组合进行zlib压缩，得到密钥。
    解密流程：密钥解压，得到原大小，边裁剪数，种子组合，通过种子生成图块组合顺序和旋转顺序，然后将加密图像拆解成图块，最后将图块反向组合成原图形。

使用：
    根据界面提示操作即可，加密后注意保存密钥，每次加密生成的密钥都不同。
    加密图片具有一定的抗损坏能力，在图片被压缩，轻度裁剪时，仍然可以解密出仅有信息的图片，可能导致失真，在解密时至少保证图片左上角完整

使用场景：
    适用于对图像进行加密，防止被阅读、屏蔽等。
    可以在公共社交平台上传。
    也可以用于个人隐私保护，加密图片后，只有拥有密钥的用户才能解密，保护个人隐私。

注意事项：
    加密图像的大小会比原图大，加密时间也会增加。
    加密图像的边裁剪数越多，加密效果越好，但加密时间也会增加。
    加密图像后注意保存密钥，每次加密生成的密钥都不同。
    加密后再解密时，注意选择的输入图片是否是加密图像。

作者的话：
    因为本人是python开发的新手，所以项目代码写的并不好看，后续也不打算修改项目。
    这个项目的想法很简单，就是通过对图像进行拆解再混合达到加密的效果。通过这种方式，可以将原图形的大小、边裁剪数、种子等信息隐藏在加密图像中，达到加密的效果。
    这个项目的实现难度不大，主要是对图像的拆解、组合、旋转等操作需要熟悉。

Project Name: Image Mixing Encryption

Project description: The effect of encryption is achieved by disassembling and mixing the image.

Encryption and decryption process:
Encryption process: when the graph is ready to be disassembled, a random seed (16 bits) is generated according to the edge clipping number, and the combination order and rotation order of the image blocks are generated through the seed, and then the image blocks are combined into a complete encrypted image.
Finally, the original size of the image, the number of edge clipping and the seed combination were compressed by zlib to obtain the key.
The decryption process: decompressing the key, obtaining the original size, edge clipping number, seed combination, generating the combination order and rotation order of the patches through the seed, then disassembling the encrypted image into patches, and finally reversing the combination of the patches into the original graphics.

Use:
After encryption, pay attention to save the key. The key generated by each encryption is different.
The encrypted image has a certain ability to resist damage. When the image is compressed and lightly cropped, it can still decrypt the image with only information, which may lead to distortion

Use Cases:
It is suitable for encrypting images to prevent them from being read and shielded.
It can be uploaded on public social platforms.
It can also be used for personal privacy protection. After encrypting the image, only the user with the key can decrypt it to protect personal privacy.

Notes:
The size of the encrypted image will be larger than the original image, and the encryption time will increase.
The more the number of edge cropping of the encrypted image, the better the encryption effect, but the encryption time will also increase.
After encrypting the image, attention is paid to saving the key, and the key generated by each encryption is different.
When encrypting and then decrypting, pay attention to whether the input image is encrypted or not.

The author's words:
Because I am new to python development, so the project code is not good to write, and I do not plan to change the project in the future.
The idea of this project is simple. It is to create encryption by disassembling and mixing images. In this way, information such as the size of the original graph, the number of edge cuts, and the seed can be hidden in the encrypted image to achieve the effect of encryption.
The implementation of this project is not difficult, mainly for image disassembly, combination, rotation and other operations need to be familiar.
